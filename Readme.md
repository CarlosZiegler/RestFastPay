## About

Contactless restaurant payment app, allowing automated checkout for restaurants and online payment for their customers. The app used not only JSON web tokens, but also a pdf receipt generator and a QR code scanning functionality (and much more).

## Why


The recent Coronavirus pandemic has not only scared the hell out of everyone, but also boosted the development of all things contactless.
Since money and credit card terminals are extremely exposed to contamination and hard to disinfect, the next thing contactless will probably be  a payment app.
Additional benefit for restaurants and bars is the automated checkout.
For customers - the ability to get their receipt as a .pdf file.
